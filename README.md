# Bank Test

## About

This is the first tech test of Makers week ten. Here I create a command line program where the user can deposit money into their bank account, withdraw funds from their bank account, show their balance, show their transactions and print out a full statement.

## Technologies Used

Code written in JavaScript with Node.js runtime environment, unit tests performed in Jest.

## Usage

2) Ensure you are in the project root.
2) Run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.
3) Run ```node``` to start the Node REPL.
4) Enter ```const BankAccount = require('./bankAccount.js')``` to require the module.
5) Initialize your account with ```new BankAccount()```.
